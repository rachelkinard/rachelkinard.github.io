            <h1>OBJECTIVE</h1>
            <p>Need for a platform that could search for package location, manage internal and external communications, and manage progress of delivery.</p>
			<p>After implementation of the first phase of the project the customer reported that their package lookup turn-around time was reduced from five days to two and a half days.</p>
			<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
			<p>Through the team's efforts we were able to visually design an application that empowered the users to feel that "it's so intuitive; it's like you took all the things in my head and what I have to do, and put it in one screen."</p>
			<p class="detail-title"><b>03 Mood Boards</b></p>
			<p>Each moodboard included a short write up about the considerations for the design approach, visual inspiration from found sites, and visual direction for select components.</p>
			<p class="detail-title"><b>01 Research Readout</b></p>
			<p>We delivered a comprehensive readout that addressed the pain points found in the interviews, current dashboard walk through, and on-site walk throughs.
			An outline of design principles that were implemented in our designs and detailed information on how and why we used them.
			We also provided KPI’s that would have the most impact with a plan that phased each feature.</p>
			<p class="detail-title"><b>01 Interactive Prototype</b></p>
			<p>We designed an interactive prototype that leveraged a user journey to illustrate the features of the new design. With the help of the moodboards we were able to provide visuals and content to the design so that it seemed more realistic.</p>

	<!-- DISCOVERY -->

            <h1>DISCOVERY</h1>
			<p class="detail-title"><b>Software Limitations</b></p>
			<p>Package tracking was outdated and the images captured by facility hardware were often poor and missing data. No access to up-to-date information made it difficult to do things like verify a location’s appearance, building type, and package recipients correct information.</p>
			<p>Out-date user interface lead to frustration in using the software, was roughly 20 years old and added on features that often had different UX and UI.</p>
			<p>The easiest fix was updating the UI and UX of the current software by providing a design system for a dashboard that housed all important information for each employee along a package’s journey.</p>
			<p>External software/applications were used most times to link missing data from internal records.</p>
			<p class="detail-title"><b>Methodology Limitations</b></p>
			<p>High and low performing facilities were selected to gather research, this helped to determine why procedures worked for some and not for others.</p>
			<p>Specialized methodologies for things like their time zone or facility size made the difference between the poor and great performance of each location.</p>
			<p>From the research gathered, we distilled procedures that worked and adapted them to a universal standard. For example, precomposed messages improved speed at which an employee could reach out to a customer and help recover packages. Adding map images of delivery locations allowed for couriers to know ahead of time.</p>
			<p>Packages that were accidentally set aside became lost in the shuffle. With lack of designated spaces for packages that had marred labels employees would put them in different locations leading to wasted time to track them down.</p>
			<p class="detail-title"><b>Technologic Limitations</b></p>
			<p>Location size and vehicles were accounted for in the research since they equal impact on package delivery as the facilities did. Often times, locations that had newer vehicles were able to recover and deliver quicker.</p>
			<p>There was a need for real-time communication with couriers and facility staff in recovering a package. The older software was unable to interact with newer technology which lead to slower recovery time.</p>
			<p>A backend overhaul outline we provided explored ways in which they could connect employees which each other and customers through technology they use presently as well as in the future.</p>
			<p>Systems used to track packages were disjointed, often times multiple programs and manual forms had to be used in order to figure out a package’s journey.</p>

			<p class="detail-title"><b>Table Stakes for the Dashboard</b></p>
			<p>Time specific notifications for employees to know the local time a delivery was made and when they need to have delivered by.</p>
			<p>Communications templates took the pressure off of employees spending time to compose an email or message needing to be sent to a customer by allowing them to input their information.</p>
			<p>Providing employees with relevant facility contacts expedited communication helped them to reduce the time spent finding missing packages.</p>
			<p class="detail-title"><b>Wireframing</b></p>
			<p>When I was provided with preliminary research I was able to determine which patterns would best suit the needs of a user performing tasks like searching, communicating, and data entry.
			I put together rough blocks of content around these subjects and produced many combinations of each to provide three different approaches to solving the package tracking problem.</p>

            <p class="detail-title"><b>Moodboard explorations</b></p>
			<p>Leveraging the inspiration I had found at the beginning of the project helped to form three directions we could provide the client for the new look and feel of their dashboard.</p>
			<p class="detail-title"><b>Space and Bold Color</b></p>
			<p>This option leverages the subtle contrasts with san serif and serif typefaces with the mix of rule lines, colored sections, and flat design to create a clean and modern aesthetic.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="detail-title"><b>Neutral greys with saturated colors and contrasting type</b></p>
			<p>Boxes direct the eye to points of interest and icons help to determine if action can be used or is needed. Oversized and weighted typography makes obvious what the user is viewing or if they can interact with an element; sparing use of color assists the rest.</p>

			<p class="detail-title"><b>Depth and layering punctuated with colorful backgrounds</b></p>
			<p>A clean and familiar approach to that of a beloved browser, use of drop shadow, lightly variated type treatments, and color compose a system that’s friendly yet actionable.</p>
