		  <p class="detail-title"><b>User Flow</b></p>
		  <p>
			  I’ve designed five main screens that Rick accesses while using the Do Stuff app. 
		  </p>
		  <p>
			  First, he opens the app and is greeted with a page that shows him most recent events that have happened with friends or ones that are coming up.
			  The intent is to give relevant information to his schedule.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			  Second, Rick chooses to view his feed which shows him a chronologically based list of events that have happened.
			  He searches for some of the places he visited when he first moved to Austin by adding filters to the feed like “2017” and “Friends” to surface the most relevant events he had tagged in the past.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			  Third, Rick sees his dog in one of the photos on the Pool Party card and selects it to see more detail about the event that he had written about it before.
			  When he opens the event card he is able to see the location, time, and date of the event as well as the tags assigned, friends who attended, and finally a feed of all the photos and videos captured during the Pool Party.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			  Fourth, remembering all the fun he had Rick goes into the Events section of the app to recall what else he had done when he had just moved.
			  He finds the month he arrived in Austin and is able to see what events he did as well as what his friends did during this time last year.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			  Fifth, Rick remembers it has been almost a year since his pool party.
			  He creates an event and invites all of his friends to join in on the fun so they can make a tradition of having annual pool parties.

	<!-- Detail Panel -->
      <div class="proj-category">
        <div class="container">
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
              <p class="detail-title"><b>Overview</b></p>
			  <p>
				  Rick is in need of an application that can keep up with his lifestyle.
				  During the first year he moved to Austin Rick kept journals of places he visited and would catalogue photos and notes and at times glue pictures to the pages as a reminder of the fun times.
				  After his third journal, Rick found keeping them was laborious and inefficient.
			  </p>
			  <p class="detail-title"><b>Process</b></p>
			  <p>
				  Using an existing system, I built out basic parts that I thought would be useful starting with event cards.
				  This exploration helped me to determine the content that should go in the cards and ultimately each page.
				  I outlined a simple site map and organized content where I thought it would best fit.
				  After going through a few rounds of what a news feed style page may look like I used that as the basis for the rest of the compositions.
			  </p>
			  <p class="detail-title"><b>Visual Design</b></p>
			  <p>
				  With the inspiration provided to me I played with a few color schemes and enjoyed the warm colorful approach given the content at hand.
				  I used black for main actions like search to give it prominence without making it large.
				  The combination of serif and san serif fonts help to give an almost newspaper approach to be more inviting to read.
				  Imagery is large and gives an idea as to what happened during a given event as well as who was there making it easy to scan past event with ease.
			  </p>
			  <p class="detail-title"><b>Interaction Design</b></p>
			  <p>
				  Although I have no motion or interactivity demonstrated for this app, I’ve intentionally placed event cards onto the edge of the screen to indicate a sort of drill down.
				  Subtle animations that guide the user would be ideal so as to not making navigating a jarring experience.
			  </p>
			  <p class="detail-title"><b>Workflow</b></p>
			  <p>
				  I built the app in two versions: iPhone X and iPad Pro to illustrate range of the layout.
				  With the iPad being a similar width to most smaller desktop screens I placed items like a rail nav on the left, out of the way of most mouse traffic; this would also be handy for a touchscreen as well.
				  With the mobile designs I have kept most of my action items onto the right side of the screen in a more comfortable location for someone to be able to use with one hand if need be.
				  For more explicit actions I’ve moved the search and create new items at the top so as to avoid mistakenly selecting them while navigating the app. 
			  </p>
			  <p class="detail-title"><b>Ideation</b></p>
			  <p>
				  I wanted to keep this app simple for the approach by allowing for three main actions for the user.
				  It has the potential to scale easily though to include things like composing reviews or adding more details to events making them similar to a blog post.
				  Most everything used to build this app is modular, so from a production standpoint there are a lot of new items that can be made from the existing ones used in this example.

			  <p>
				  I’ve included a few other pages in my file that give example to how I work.
				  Included is a few components that are special for this app and the other is some of the inspiration I gathered as well as event cards and a basic list of how I organized the app.
