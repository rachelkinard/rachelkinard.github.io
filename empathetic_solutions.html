            <h1>DISCOVERY</h1>
            <p>It became apparent early in this phase that the issue was beyond the Sales and Renewal steps in the company's workflow.
			We mapped out the current journey to illustrate the pain points and prototyped a future journey to gather input on how business units would optimize together.</p>
			<p class="detail-title">PAIN POINT 01: <b>Workflow Prioritization</b></p>
			<p>During the Sales and Renewal process information between units was often kept siloed from each other. Insight into subjects such as client needs, service requests, and prioritization was often missing. Units would operate largely on assumption than knowledge.</p>
			<p class="detail-title">PAIN POINT 02: <b>Centralized Information</b></p>
			<p>With locations across the country and a large number of employees file storage was rationed which lead to many workarounds. These limitations meant lack of database and access for communications, requirements, and documentation.</p>
			<p class="detail-title">PAIN POINT 03: <b>Employee Collaboration</b></p>
			<p>Best practices were kept within business units and often times not shared by individuals. The lack of knowledge transfer meat that remaining members had to spend time figuring out how make up for the team’s loss.</p>
			<p class="detail-title"><b>Outcomes from the Client Workshop</b></p>
			<p>8 roadmaps: 4 maps that represented the needs, wants, and desires for the future, the other 4 maps detailed where the pain points lie and ideas for how to alleviate them.</p>
			<p>8 concept posters: Each team created an idea that they thought would have the highest business impact while addressing our tension points.</p>
			<p>1 business impact sizing chart that each participant placed a vote on. They considered the impact, cost, level of effort, and time it would take to execute each concept.</p>

            <h1>Data Synthesis</h1>
            <p>We provided a deck readout that outlined our solutions that impacted the tensions with the highest business value. Each solution addressed the people, processes, and tools involved  to help our client more easily implement over time.</p>

            <p>We compiled a comprehensive readout which outlined diagnosis of tensions in their organization that lie in three subjects: accountability, collaboration, and prioritization of their business units and company as a whole.
			With these findings we were able to construct a “Do Now, Do Next, Do Later” action list to help them get on the right track for a more successful future with tangible results.</p>
