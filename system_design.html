			<p class="detail-title"><b>01 Design System</b></p>
			<p>I started with a simple system as a master library to draw upon for each project. These parts would be used to build more complex components that I could make specialized for the project.</p>
			<p class="detail-title"><b>02 Example Products</b></p>
			<p>I used two prompts to illustrate the breadth the simple library could address.</p>

            <p>This is an example of a simple design system that is built following the rules of the <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" target="_blank">Atomic Design Principles</a>.
			In this example I’ve also used units of 8px for my grid and my components with exceptions of 3’s and 4’s on occasion.
			Using these values are helpful for responsive design when a user views this app on a phone or a desktop the system will scale appropriately and should have need for roughly 3 breakpoints: mobile, tablet, and desktop.</p>

            <h1>Productivity Application Prompt</h1>
			<p>Rick just moved to Austin last year, and he’s in love with this town! In his first months, his new friends took him to all sorts of restaurants, parks, events, galleries… He felt like every day was a vacation, and even now, a year later, he makes an effort to keep exploring.</p>
			<p>At first, he bought the journal just to learn his way around. Now that he’s on his third journal, he frequently refers to the old ones when he’s looking for something to do. After he finishes a journal, he goes back through and color-codes the pages with highlighters so he can easily flip to pages with certain attributes.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, Rick browses his journals just to take a trip down memory lane. He tried gluing photos into his first one, but quickly discovered that doing so wrinkled the pages and made the book too thick, so he stopped.<p>
			<p class="detail-title"><b>Process</b></p>
			<p>Using the existing system, I built out basic parts that I thought would be useful starting with event cards. This exploration helped me to determine the content that should go in the cards and ultimately each page. I outlined a simple site map and organized content where I thought it would best fit.
			After going through a few rounds of what a news feed style page may look like I used that as the basis for the rest of the compositions.</p>
			<p class="detail-title"><b>Influential Factors</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li><p><b>A mobile first approach:</b> The examples used are scalable designs that can adapt to mobile and desktop.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Avoid cognitive overload:</b> Make use of imagery over text when possible to provide visual summarizations of an entry.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Provide contextual and relevant information:</b> Major activities are simplified by breaking them down into steps making them more manageable across each platform.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="detail-title"><b>Download the Do Stuff Application: Step 1 of 5</b></p>
			<p>Rick downloads the Do Stuff app, as a new user he has the option to use a third party app to sign in. Since Rick doesn’t have an account the option to sign into Do Stuff is unavailable. He opts to sign up to Do Stuff.</p>

			</div>
			
			<p class="detail-title"><b>User Login: Step 2 of 5</b></p>
			<p>Rick is required to enter his username, email address, and password. After inputting his credentials, he continues the sign up process. He’s prompted to include optional information about himself. This helps the app to auto populate the information in his profile.</p>

			<p class="detail-title"><b>First Journal Entry: Step 3 of 5</b></p>
			<p>Rick views his dashboard for the first time and because he’s a new user he has no journal entries yet. There is a graphic to guide him to create a new entry.</p>
			<p>Composing a new entry he sees an empty field with a subject line and space beneath for his entry. As he writes, he’s able to add images and links as well as basic text formatting. After he writes his entry, he presses the check and has the option to Save Draft or Preview.</p>

			</div>
			
			<p class="detail-title"><b>Publish Entry: Step 4 of 5</b></p>
			<p>After Rick chooses to preview his entry he can add settings and tags to help keep track of his entry for future searches. He also has the option to share on other social media sites like Facebook.</p>
			<p>Once he’s done reviewing his entry Rick publishes it and is taken to his dashboard where his new entry is marked with a temporary “published’ label.</p>

			<p class="detail-title"><b>Browse Journal Entries: Step 5 of 5</b></p>
			<p>After a few months have passed, Rick wants to look back on what he did shortly after moving to Austin. He starts searching “party” in the dashboard and as he’s typing the relevant results populate in real time.</p>
			<p>Extra: He views a journal of entries he wrote about his Pinballz tournament week.</p>
